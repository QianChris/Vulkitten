## Task 1: Complete Basic RenderGraph Invocation
- **Start**: 2026-06-19
- **End**: 2026-06-19
- **Summary**: Implemented RenderGraph::Execute() with command filtering by pass name. Created PreparePass (ClearCommand → Legacy::RenderCommand::Clear), SpriteRenderPass (DrawQuadCommand → Renderer2D batch), EndPass (SwapBuffers via GraphicsContext). Wired passes in Renderer::Init(). Moved SwapBuffers from WindowsWindow::OnUpdate to EndPass. Updated Scene::OnUpdate to set camera on graph and skip direct RenderScene when systems are present. Updated RenderSystem to emit ClearCommand. Removed direct Clear calls from ExampleLayer2. Added RenderPass.cpp with SetExecute/Read/Write implementations. Added GetGraphicsContext() to Window interface. Fixed EditorLayer to use Legacy::RenderCommand. All 3 targets compile.
